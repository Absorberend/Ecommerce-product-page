# E-commerce product page
This is my solution for the "E-commerce product page" challenge of Frontend Mentor.

What I like about Frontend Mentor is that they give you some details about what they like to see and sometimes some images but that's about it.
You're not given a solution so it's all on you to try and recreate the project as accurately as possible.

This was the first time I created a thumbnail product gallery, a hamburger menu button and a functional shopping cart.
